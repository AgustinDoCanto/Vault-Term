## Notes of the software

All the changes are made in the filesystem of your machine so you can move and create folders as you wish for create or delete projects or create a new Project-Vault but the goal of this sofware is to simplify that process oriented to notetaking and productivity. 

Also the software is in a development fase so may not have all the bounds checks and validations so made changes on your own risk.

## Definitions

### What is the Project-Vault?

The Project-Vault is the central piece of the software and is created when you create your first Project. Is the folder where all the Projects are saved.

For now you can only have one Project-Vault where Vault-Term was installed but you can create how many backups you want in another directorys.

To create backups of the Project-Vault pick on the "Create Backup" option in the main menu.


### What is a Project?

A Project is a folder created into the Project-Vault and it contains all the .md files (or with another extension), 

The Projects would be created into the Project-Vault and is basically a folder where you would create and save all the .md files, or files with another extension, for after edition or consulting.  


### Project-Vault and Projects structure tree

The Project-Vault tree should be like this:
